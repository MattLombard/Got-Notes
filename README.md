# Got Notes

## Description

The Note Taker application provides users with a simple and intuitive interface for creating and managing notes. Upon opening the application, users are presented with a landing page that includes a link to the notes page. Clicking on the link takes users to a page where existing notes are listed in the left-hand column, while the right-hand column contains empty fields for entering a new note's title and text. As users enter new notes, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. Clicking on this icon saves the new note and adds it to the list in the left-hand column. Users can click on any existing note in the list to view it in the right-hand column or click on the Write icon to create a new note. With this application, users can easily create, organize, and access their notes from a centralized location.
